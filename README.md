The original dataset for this study is hosted in the Data Archive of the BRAIN Initiative (DABI; https://dabi.loni.usc.edu/dsi/U01NS117836) and is available upon request. No participant's identifiable information will be disclosed. The datasets generated and/or analyzed, and the statistical tests used during the current study, are attached as Source Data and Supplementary Data files.

Some of the intermediate data can be found in the data folder. 
The analysis scripts are formatted as an IPython notebook in the figures\_scripts folder. The majority of the analysis was performed in Python, and STN single-unit localization was performed in MATLAB using custom scripts in the ST\_SU\_location folder.
